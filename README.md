# Scrum To Go 0.5
![](/scrum-to-go2.svg#size=20,align=center)

## What is it?
It is a tool to manage your IT work in an almost agile approach

## Why "to go"?
Because:
- simple
- federated and decentralized if you want, meaning *no server*
- hackable for hackers: cmd line tool and data in Markdown files
- documentation: come with embedded library  
- and more: Gantt, Kanban, time reporting tool


## How come?
Few years ago I worked with a frugal manager who didn't want to pay for Agile operational tools. I looked for free solutions but I could not find any. So now there is one.

## Why 0.5?
Because I guess it is half the way to be very useful and bugs free. 
__Suggestions are Welcome!__

## Where con I find it?
- A demo version without permanent storage on AWS [https://demo.scrum-to-go.com/]
- Local install for Linux and Windows on https://github.com/code-to-go/stg-dist
- Docker image on [ghcr.io/code-to-go/stg:0.5.0]. An easy way is to download and run the file [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-to-go/stg-dist/main/stg-docker]
